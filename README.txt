"Make Myself Clear" is a web application that scans social networks, Facebook and Twitter, for potentially sensitive information associated with you.

Have you been posting angry?

Been seeking online support for your upcoming surgery?

These things can cloud the way look online. When you tweet, share, like, and post, you're sharing with potential employers, future romantic partners, savvy parents, and other enquiring minds.

Scan your social network activity for potentially sensitive information - if it happens that you're not the angel you thought, make yourself clear.
